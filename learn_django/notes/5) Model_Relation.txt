   There are three types of Model Relations
    - One-to-One Relations
    - One-to-Many Relations
    - Many-to-Many Relations

1. One-to-One Relation
    If Student is a model and StudentProfile is the model with one-one relation 
    with Student table then following are the related ORMs

    i) StudentProfile.objects.create(roll_no=2, contact=987438947, student_id=1)

    ii) student = Student = Student.objects.get(id=2)
        StudentProfile.objects.create(roll_no=1, contact=9736535623, student=student)

    iii) sp = StudentProfile.objects.get(id=2)
    print(sp.contact)
    print(sp.roll)
    print(sp.student.name)
    print(sp.studnet.email)

    iv) StudentProfile.objects.filter(roll_no=2,student_name="Jon")
